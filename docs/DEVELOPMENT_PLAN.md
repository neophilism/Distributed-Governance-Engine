# Distributed-Governance-Engine development plan

Approved task scope: the owner's October 16, 2026 request for the shared document engine and two thin applications. Maintainer-authored decomposition version 1. This is a development plan, not a claim that the owner separately reviewed each PR.

The only machine-readable plan is registry/prs.json (39 units). Detailed implementation/acceptance/test/migration specs are in docs/prs/. Unit numbers are stable IDs, never GitHub PR numbers. The foundation is mapped to actual GitHub PR #1; live GitHub owns its current state. Do not equate a foundation commit with accepted unit completion.

Proceed in dependency order. After each real PR, validate, fix failures, merge only when live GitHub current-head checks and merge preflight permit, update mappings/evidence and continue. Never make human review a development prerequisite. Capacity, required credentials and spending are concrete states; continue independent ready work when one is unavailable.

Release gates: exact-head required CI; applicable security/authorization/accessibility/migration/browser/load tests; isolated approved infrastructure; authentic deployed commit and health evidence; real multiuser and independent artifact-verification journeys. Final human review occurs after deployment, without inventing independent review or certification evidence.

DCE-004 is implemented in actual merged PR #2. The editor foundation contributes to DCE-005; inline link UI, authenticated durable save, IME/network/browser/accessibility evidence and production integration remain incomplete. Contributions must never count as completed unit acceptance.

DCE-002 has a partial server implementation for OIDC login, persisted sessions, membership/invitations, scoped database permissions and audit events. See IDENTITY_FOUNDATION.md and decisions/0002-low-cost-identity.md. Recovery, passkey/device assurance and deployment acceptance remain planned. HTTP/account UI integration now has a TLS browser test with a synthetic provider, pending production acceptance. No hosted service or paid resource is created for this contribution.

The recovery contribution adds rotating, single-use recovery codes, atomic session invalidation, a short read-only recovery session and minimal security-event evidence. It deliberately does not treat recovery as recent OIDC authentication or encrypted-device enrollment. Full provider-loss restoration, passkeys/device assurance and production acceptance remain planned.

The passkey/device-assurance contribution adds verifier-backed, session-bound WebAuthn ceremony state, credential/counter persistence, fresh local step-up and separately revocable device public-key thumbprints. It deliberately does not ship custom attestation cryptography, content keys or a private-workspace authorization claim. Real browser/authenticator interoperability, attestation policy, membership rekeying and production acceptance remain planned.

DCE-005 also includes literal body-text find/replace, bounded replace-all with one-step undo, Unicode-aware positions, safe failures and readonly search. Schema v2 and the editor now preserve canonical HTTPS link/citation atoms with an explicit v1 migration; link editing/removal, richer citation metadata, authenticated save and real-browser/IME/network/accessibility acceptance remain unfinished. Local DOM interaction tests do not establish real-browser layout or screen-reader behavior.

The DCE-002 authentication-time follow-up binds privileged-action freshness to verified provider authentication time, preserves migration 001, and adds ordered migration 002. Legacy sessions without this evidence require a fresh login. Tests cover time-window extension, backward-clock handling and preservation of old account/session records during upgrade.

The public saved-document contribution adds authorized persistence, serial autosave, immutable history, read-only public links and source freezing. It contributes to DCE-005/008 without completing private encryption, realtime merge or editor acceptance. See PUBLIC_DOCUMENTS.md. Public commitments remain pending until later chain finality verification; no paid service is created.

The DCE-009 contribution binds paragraph selections to exact immutable source editions, stores public replacement proposals and rationales, and connects a slide-out review panel. Creation currently requires a workspace contributor role. Public participation policy, structured points/votes, proposal revisions and governance adoption remain unfinished. See TEXT_PROPOSALS.md.

Structured public pro/con/clarification points, typed replies and independent point ratings now contribute to DCE-015/016. Ranking has bounded generation-aware pagination; votes have safe retries, history, self-vote rejection and concurrent-change checks. Workspace contributors only; reputation, moderation, public admission and decision ballots remain pending. See STRUCTURED_DISCUSSION.md.
